# MovieInternet

**Why did we start this project**
We are a group of ICT students that would like to get deeper into the subjects such as AI, front end development and overall development of the applications according to the industry standards. This project is overlooked by our mentor/projectlead ...

**Which technologies did we use**

**Working with github:**  
We would like to bring everybody in the team up to speed and set in stone in what way we'll set up our github repository and which rules every member of the team will have to follow. 



*   When to pull
    * Fetch origin - Fetching code from the remote repository
    * Merge - Combining changes from different files
  
* what are commits - uploading changes to the local repository
* what is push - uploading changes from local to remote repository
* When to push - when you have pulled
*   
  **Working with branches**

  * Copy of the source code you don't want to mess with
  * You want to know exactly what changes have been made in this way it's much easier to navigate when something in the code went wrong 
  * branch - copy of what is already working
  * git tracks changes using different algorithms
  * Git recognizes different types of content
  * add empty lines → Git sees them as insertions
  * change lines → Git sees them as modifications
  * remove lines → Git sees them as deletions

  - what is container, what is docker image, what is dockerfile, what is docker-compose
  - lets say I am working with branches on git and I have a main, frontand1 and frontend2 lets say that programmer A has modified and pushed changes to the "buttonFunction" in frontend 1. Afterward the programmer B has made changes in the "buttonFunction" in the frontend2 and then pulled the changes from git, with which version of the "buttonFunction" would Programmer B end up with?
  - what if programmers A changes would be to push enter just ones at the beginning of the function. and programmer B changed a couple lines of code. 
  If programmer B would pull origin of frontend1 would he now have to resolve a merge conflict seeing that no all the lines have been moved by one?
  How could programmer B solve that issue and merge code implementing both changes?

Directories
* Working directory
- Git clone
* Staging area
* Local Repository
* Remote repository



**Setting up dualboot windows/linux**

**Getting started with docker**

What is docker
* Are like virtual machines, so 'micro computers' running on your computer
    * Each their own operating system
    * Each their own isolated CPU
    * Dockers can be easily added, removed, stopped, and started without affecting host or other dockers
* A docker has a VERY specific job. They DONT simulate the entire computer like virtual machines
    * Jobs like running a MYSQL database or a NodeJS application
* Dockers can be connected together

Benefits
* software on docker container can be deployed to any machine without compatibility issues
  * Simpler to use
  * Less work to develop
  * Less work to maintain
